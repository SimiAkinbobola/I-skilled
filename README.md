# Candidate Assessment & Petition Management Application

This repository contains a Flask-based web application designed to streamline candidate assessment for immigration petitions (e.g., EB1A, EB2, EB2_NIW, EB3). The application handles user authentication, candidate data collection, automated scoring and analysis, file uploads (including resumes, financial proofs, exhibits, etc.), petition detail management, and even AI-powered content generation via Deepseek.

## Features

- **User Authentication::**  
  Secure login with a two-step verification process (password plus one-time code sent via email).

- **Candidate Submission:**  
  A multi-part form allows for detailed input including personal information, education, work experience, achievements, publications, skills, and more.

- **Automated Candidate Assessment:**  
  The system automatically scores and assesses candidates based on the selected visa category using weighted criteria.

- **File Upload & Management:**  
  Upload and manage candidate files such as resumes, financial proofs, exhibits, etc. Files are organized into structured candidate folders and can be renamed via API.

- **Petition Generation & PDF Download:**  
  Generate petitions and cover letters; export candidate petitions as PDF documents using pdfkit.

- **Reports & Dashboards:**  
  Visual reports with charts for candidate scores, work experience distribution, education levels, top companies, and more.

- **AI Content Generation:**  
  Utilize Deepseek’s API (integrated via an OpenAI-like client) to generate custom content such as cover letters, proposed endeavor introductions, and more.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git

2. **Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies:
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
      pip install -r requirements.txt

## Ensure Required Folders Exist:
The application automatically creates necessary folders (e.g., uploads, data, Credential) if they do not exist.

## Configuration

Configure the application using the Config class in config.py. Ensure the following settings are defined:

## Secret Keys & API Keys:
SECRET_KEY, SENDGRID_API_KEY, DEEPSEEK_API, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY, PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY, PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY, etc.

File & Data Paths:
Paths for UPLOAD_FOLDER, DATA_FOLDER, and the candidates file (CANDIDATES_FILE).

Allowed File Extensions:
Define a set of allowed file extensions (e.g., {'pdf', 'doc', 'docx', 'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg'}).

## Example configuration snippet:

    import os
    
    class Config:
        SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', 'your_default_secret_key')
        UPLOAD_FOLDER = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'uploads')
        DATA_FOLDER = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'data')
        CANDIDATES_FILE = os.path.join(DATA_FOLDER, 'candidates.json')
        ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'pdf', 'doc', 'docx', 'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg'}
        SENDGRID_API_KEY = os.environ.get('SENDGRID_API_KEY')
        STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY')
        STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.environ.get('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY')
        PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY = os.environ.get('PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY')
        PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY')
        PAYSTACK_BASE_URL = os.environ.get('PAYSTACK_BASE_URL')
        DEEPSEEK_API = os.environ.get('DEEPSEEK_API_KEY')
        PDF_CONFIG = {
            'wkhtmltopdf': os.environ.get('WKHTMLTOPDF_PATH', '/usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf')
        }
### Usage
